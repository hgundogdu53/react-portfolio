        Hi, there! This is Huseyin Gundogdu who currently lives in San Francisco
        Bay Area. I am an enthusiast to develop websites, especially using
        HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, React, NodeJS, Express, NextJS,
        MongoDB, GraphQL and PostgreSQL. Besides that, Cloud computing is one of
        the my interests and I achieved AWS Solution Architect-Associate and
        freeCodeCamp Frontend Libraries certificates. Outside of coding, my
        interest areas are swimming, soccer, hiking and black tea. Feel free to
        get in touch by any means of communication.
